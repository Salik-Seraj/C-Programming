    //TODO Why Loops :- Sometimes we want our programs to execute few set of instructions over and over again far ex, printing 1 to 100 , first 100 even numbers etc. Hence loops make it easy for a programmer to tell computer that a given set of instructions must be executed repeatelly.

    return 0;
}

//FIXME: Types of loops :- 

//FIXME: 1) While loop
//FIXME: 2) do - while loop
//FIXME: 3) for loop

/*While loop
while (condition is true) {
    //code to be executed ==> The block keeps executing as long as the condition is true.
}
*/
//TODO: i++ Increment operator :- pehle print fir incriment
//TODO: ++I Pehle increment fir print kare
//TODO: += is compound assignment operator. Just like -=, *=, /= & %=


//TODO: do - while loop works very similar to while loop. 
// while --> checks the condition & then executes the code.
// do - while --> Executes the code and then checks the condition.

// do-while loop = while loop which executes at least once.

/*
do - while loop
The syntax of do - while loop looks like this:
do {
    code;
    code;
    code;
} while (condition);
*/

//TODO: For Loop :- The syntax of for loop looks like this :

/* for (initialize; test; increment or decrement);
{
code;
code;
}
*/

//FIXME: Initialize --> Setting a loop counter to an initial value 
//FIXME: Test --> Checking a condition
//FIXME: Increment -->
