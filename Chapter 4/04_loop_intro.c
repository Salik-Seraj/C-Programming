    //TODO Why Loops :- Sometimes we want our programs to execute few set of instructions over and over again far ex, printing 1 to 100 , first 100 even numbers etc. Hence loops make it easy for a programmer to tell computer that a given set of instructions must be executed repeatelly.
       
    return 0;
}

//FIXME: Types of loops :- 

//FIXME: 1) While loop
//FIXME: 2) do - while loop
//FIXME: 3) for loop

/*While loop
while (condition is true) {
    //code to be executed ==> The block keeps executing as long as the condition is true.
}
