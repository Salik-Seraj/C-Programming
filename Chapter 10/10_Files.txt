                               🪯 CHAPTER 10 - FILES I/O 🪯 

The random access memory is volatile and its content is lost once the program terminates. In order to presist the data forever we use files.

A file is data stored in a storage device. A C program can talk to the files by reading content from it and writing content to it.


   C Program --------->  Files
               write 
            <----------
             Read  


🔹File Pointer :-

The "FILE" is a structure which needs to be created for opening the file.

A file pointer is a pointer to this structure of the file.

                                      FILE pointer is needed for communication between the program and the file.


A FILE pointer can be created as follow:

FILE *ptr;
ptr = fopen("filename.txt", "Mode");

➡️ File Opening Modes In C

C offers the programmers to select a mode for opening a file.
Following modes are primarily used in C FILE i/O

1. "r" --> open for reading  → if the file does not exist, fopen returns
2. "rb" --> open for reading in binary   → NULL
3. "w" --> open for writing → if the file exists, the content will be overwritten.
4. "wb" --> open for writing in binary
5. "a" --> open for append → If the file does not exists, it will be created.


  ⟫⟫ Types Of Files

  There are two types of files:

  1. Text files (.txt, .c)
  2. Binary files (.jpg, .dat)

  Reading a file
  A file can be opened for reading as follow:
  FILE *ptr;
  ptr = fopen("Hello.txt", "r");
  int num;

  Let us assume that "Hello.txt" contains an integer we can read that integer using:
  fscanf(ptr, "%d", &num);  => fsanf is file counterpart of scanf

  This will read an integer from file in num variable.


  Closing The File
  It i svery imporation to close the file after read or write. This is acheived using fclose as follows:

  fclose(ptr);

  This will tell the compiler that we are done working with the file and the associated resources could be freed.

  Writing to a File
  We can write to a file in a very similar manner like we read the file

  FILE *ptr;
  fptr = fopen("Hello.txt", "w");
