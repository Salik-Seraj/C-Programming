                               🪯 CHAPTER 10 - FILES I/O 🪯 

The random access memory is volatile and its content is lost once the program terminates. In order to presist the data forever we use files.

A file is data stored in a storage device. A C program can talk to the files by reading content from it and writing content to it.


   C Program --------->  Files
               write 
            <----------
             Read  


🔹File Pointer :-

The "FILE" is a structure which needs to be created for opening the file.

A file pointer is a pointer to this structure of the file.

                                      FILE pointer is needed for communication between the program and the file.


A FILE pointer can be created as follow:

FILE *ptr;
ptr = fopen("filename.txt", "Mode");

➡️ File Opening Modes In C

C offers the programmers to select a mode for opening a file.
Following modes are primarily used in C FILE i/O

1. "r" --> open for reading  → if the file does not exist, fopen returns
2. "rb" --> open for reading in binary   → NULL
3. "w" --> open for writing → if the file exists, the content will be overwritten.
4. "wb" --> open for writing in binary
5. "a" --> open for append → If the file does not exists, it will be created.
