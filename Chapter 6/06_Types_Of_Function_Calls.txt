                                        Types Of Function Calls

Based on the way we pass arguments to the Function, function calls are of two types.


1). Call By Value --> Sending the values of arguments.

2). Call By Reference --> Sending the address of arguments.

                         Call By Value
Here the value of the arguments are passed to the function. Consider this example.

int c = sum(3,4); => assume x=3 and y=4

if sum is defined as sum(int a, int b), the values 3 & 4 are copied to a & b . Now even if we change a and b, nothing happens to the variables x and y.
This is call by value.

In C we usually make a call by value.

                        Call By Reference
Here the address of the variables is passed to the function as arguments.

Now sincw the addresses are passed to the function the function can now modify the values of a variable in calling function using * and &
