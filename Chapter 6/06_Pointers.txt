                             CHAPTER 6 - POINTERS 

    A pointer is a variable which stores the address of another variable.

    i = 72                     j = 87994                            
    address--> 87994           address--> 87998

    j is a pointer 
    j points to i 

    The "address of" (8) operator 
    The address of operator is used to obtain the address of a given variable.

   Format specifier for printing pointer address is "%u" 

   The 'value at address' operator (*)
   The value at address or / operator is used to obtain the value present at a given memory address. It denoted by *

   *(8i) = 72
   *(8j) =  87994

   How to declare a pointer ?
   A pointer is declared using the following syntax

   int *j; ==> declare a variable j of type int - pointer
   j = 8i ==> Store address of i in j

   Just lik pointers of type integer, we also have pointers to char, float etc

   int * ch_ptr; --> Pointers to integer
   char * ch_ptr; --> Pointers to character
   float * ch_ptr; --> Pointers to float

   Although is a good practice to use meaningful variables names, we should be very careful while reading & working on programs from fellow programmers .

   A program to demonstrate pointers 

                               POINTER TO A POINTER 
Just like j is pointing to i or storing the address of i, we can have another variable k which can further store the address of j. What will be the type of R 

int **R;
R = 8j;

We can  even go further one level and create a variable L of type int *** to store the address of K . We mostly use int * and int **  sometimes in real world programs.
